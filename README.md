## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

- **NodeJS** (v14 or higher recommended)
- **npm** (v6 or higher recommended)
- **MongoDB** (v4.4 or higher recommended)
- **PM2** (Optional, for process management)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Download and Extract**
   ```bash
   # Download the latest release
   wget https://github.com/fantinodavide/Squad_Whitelister/releases/latest/download/release.zip
   
   # Extract the files
   unzip release.zip
   ```

2. **Initial Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Start the server for the first time
   node server
   ```
   The application will automatically stop to create the configuration file.

3. **Configure the Application**
   Edit the generated `conf.json` file according to your needs. See the [Configuration Documentation](CONFIG.md) for detailed information about all available options.

4. **Start the Server**
   ```bash
   # Using PM2 (recommended for production)
   pm2 start server.js
   
   # Without PM2, with auto-restart
   node server --self-pm
   ```

### Docker Installation

You can also run Whitelister using Docker:

```bash
# Pull and run using docker-compose
docker-compose up -d
```

## üîß Configuration

For a complete reference of all configuration options, please see the [Configuration Documentation](CONFIG.md).

### SSL Certificate Setup

To use a custom SSL certificate:

1. Place your `certificate.key` file in the **certificates** folder
2. Place your `certificate.crt` file in the **certificates** folder

### Process Management

If you're not using PM2, add the `--self-pm` argument to enable automatic restarts:

```bash
node server --self-pm
```

### Game Server Integration

To link Whitelister to your game server's `RemoteAdminListHosts.cfg`:

- Full whitelist output: `/wl` (e.g., `https://your-domain.com/wl`)
- Clan-specific whitelist: `/wl/{clan_code}` (e.g., `https://your-domain.com/wl/1a2b3c4d`)

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING` | MongoDB connection string | `mongodb://user:password@host:port/database` |
| `HIDDEN_CONFIG_TABS` | Hide specific config tabs | `web_server;database` |
| `HTTP_SERVER_DISABLED` | Disable HTTP server | `true` |
| `HTTPS_SERVER_DISABLED` | Disable HTTPS server | `true` |
| `HTTPS_PORT` | Override HTTPS port | `8443` |

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Database Connection Errors**: Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible
- **Port Conflicts**: Check if the configured ports are already in use
- **SSL Certificate Issues**: Verify certificate files are correctly formatted

### Logs

Check the application logs for detailed error information:
```bash
# If using PM2
pm2 logs server

# If using standard Node
check the console output or application log files
```
